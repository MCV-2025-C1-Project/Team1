# C1 Project
This is the Team1's project of the C1 course from the Master in Computer Vision (MCV 25-26).

This project implements a Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) algorithm to search information of museum paintings using Computer Vision (CV) techniques. The user can take a picture of a painting, pass it to the program, and will receive information of the most similar painting found in its database.
